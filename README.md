# How to execute the code using Jshell

Suppose you already install Jshell in your machine

1. Open the code in Jshell 

```
jshell> /open Main.java
```

2. Running the code

```
jshell> Solution.main("graph -N 8 -S 15")
```

After that you can see the results print out on the console.



Results including:

1. Print out the randomly generated connected direction graph
2. The eccentricity of all the Vertex
3. The diameter and radius of the randomly generated graph
4. The shortest distance path between 2 random using Dijkstra algorithm
